# pdf cli conversion tool

an extremely basic cli tool that converts 1 or more images to a clean pdf.

## using the tool

you'd need python 3.12.0 to run this tool. i'll probably make this a package so that it isn't so inconvenient to use in the future. run the commands below to run it after cloning the repo:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py /path/to/image_1.jpg /path/to/image_2.png ... -o /path/to/output.pdf
```
